# Performance Test Harness

:::note[Useful Links]

A lot of info cribbed from [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/quantum-safe/quantum-safe-remediator/1.0.x?topic=harness-installing-performance-test)

:::

## Pre-Reqs

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 
- `jq`
- `bc`

### Installing pre-requisite packages

<Tabs syncKey="OS">
  <TabItem label="Red Hat/CentOS">
```tsx
sudo dnf -y install jq bc
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Ubuntu/Debian">
```tsx
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y install jq bc
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Download the Performance Test Pack from IBM Passport Advantage:

![QSRPTH1](../../../../assets/images/QSRPTH1.png)

The file downloaded will likely be named `IQSR_1.0_Linux_EN.zip`. Extract the file.

```zsh
unzip ~/Downloads/IQSR_1.0_Linux_EN.zip
Archive:  /Users/kramerro/Downloads/IQSR_1.0_Linux_EN.zip
  inflating: M0J91EN/pqc-performance-test_1.0.0.tar
```

Upload the resultant `pqc-performance-test_1.0.0.tar` to your docker host.

On your docker host

```tsx
mkdir -p ~/perftest
tar -xf pqc-performance-test_1.0.0.tar -C ~/perftest/

```

Change over to the newly extracted directory

```tsx
cd ~/perftest/pqc-performance-test/test_utils/build_images/
```

## Install the Performance Test Harness

:::note[IBM Docs]

A lot of this stuff is take verbatim from here:

### Building the images

Execute the `build_images.sh` script and select `1` when prompted for the License Agreement.

Should show the images available now for Docker
```tsx {6-8}
docker images

REPOSITORY                                          TAG          IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
adaptive-proxy                                      ubi-9.3      99c3cd5ad80f   2 months ago    277MB

```

### Configuring the build images

:::note
This build config needs to happen for every host ip you want to check. So if you have multiple addresses, add them to the space delimited list below.
:::

Execute the `build_config.sh` script. We are going to use our test vm that is running our test site for the adaptive proxy.
Since this is running on IBM Fyre, we have two IP addresses available. We're going to point to both.

Breaking down the below requirements:

- `TARGET_FQDN_LIST` - Should be a space delimited list of ip addresses of the target hosts
- `TARGET_IP_LIST` - This should also be the same space delimited list of ips from above 
- `TESTFQDN` - This should be the same ip as the target host

For our test, we will use the ip of our docker host

```tsx
./build_config.sh

Enter the target FQDN list seperated by space (TARGET_FQDN_LIST): 9.46.72.93
Enter the target IP list seperated by space (TARGET_IP_LIST): 9.46.72.93
Enter the test FQDN (TESTFQDN): 9.46.72.93
```

The build will take a while.

After awhile you should see

```tsx
Performance test server build completed successfully.
Launching performance test server ...
Launching localhost:5000/qsc-perf-server-ubuntu:provider.
Performance test server container started RC=0, container id 318e77d157114d84915654f86cc8c3a225c689e9983bb9d38fbc6b5cbdefc22d.

```

When all is done, you should see the running test harness server container running:

```tsx
docker ps -a

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                            COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                    PORTS                                                                                                  NAMES
