## Browser configuration

For the exercises below, the browser is the client side of the proxied connection. Each browser
type can be configured to support quantum-safe kyber encryption. Chrome and Edge support kyber
encryption by default, however Firefox does not.  

Depending on the scenario, it could be desirable to either enable or disable kyber encryption 
for the browser. For example, if the scenario is a legacy encryption client connecting to a 
quantum-safe kyber encrypted application or site, then the kyber encryption would need to be 
disabled on the browser. The vice versa would also be true for a scenario where kyber encrypted
clients are connecting to a legacy encrypted application or site.

For configuration instructions, see [Enable Post Quantum Cryptography Support in Web Browsers](https://evertrust.io/education/enable-post-quantum-cryptography-support-in-web-browsers/)

:::note
As of Dec 2024, only Chromium-based browsers work in the kyber encrypted front end scenario. Use Chrome (properly configured)
for kyber encrypted client connection to the Adaptive Proxy and use Firefox for a legacy encrypted client connection.
:::

### Configuring Chrome

For quantum-safe kyber encryption through the Adaptive Proxy, you must disable the use of ML-KEM in TLS 1.3 in Chrome.
In a chrome tab, open `chrome://flags` and look for "Use ML-KEM in TLS 1.3". Select "Disabled" and relaunch the browser.

![41f0f37b-b4dc-4e59-a894-2b7d102a7574](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30c87d59-5b8b-471f-b55c-d09ac37aa4a7)

The "TLS 1.3 post-quantum key agreement" flag can remain "Default", as default enables that flag in Chrome.

## Adaptive proxy configuration

The adaptive proxy configuration consists of the following files:

- `adaptive.proxy.location.conf`
- `adaptive.proxy.upstream.conf`
- `adaptive.proxy.curvemap`
- `adaptive.proxy.passthrough.conf`

## Example setup

### Build a test site

Some of the below was pulled out of [How To Create a Self-Signed SSL Certificate for Apache in Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-apache-in-ubuntu-16-04)

#### Prerequisites

On our Linux host (Ubuntu 24.0.4 LTS), let's install httpd and npm, install corepack, enable yarn, and configure the firewall.

```
sudo apt update

sudo apt-get -y install apache2

curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo bash -

sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

sudo corepack enable
```

#### Enabling `mod_ssl`

Enable `mod_ssl` with the `a2enmod` command:

```
sudo a2enmod ssl
```

Restart Apache to activate the module:

```
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
#### Create the SSL Certificate

Create the SSL key and certificate files with the openssl command:

```
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/apache-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/apache-selfsigned.crt
```

The entirety of the prompts will look something like this:
```
Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:US
State or Province Name (full name) []:Example
Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:Example 
Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:Example Inc
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Example Dept
Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:your_domain_or_ip
Email Address []:webmaster@example.com
```

#### Build the test site

You can build a basic Hello World site or a more complex test site using Astro.

<Tabs syncKey="TestSite">
<TabItem label="Hello World">

Now let's build a basic Hello World page for Apache.

Create a directory to act as the document root.

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/test-app/build
```

Open a new `index.html` file with your text editor.

```
sudo vi /var/www/html/test-app/build/index.html
```

Paste the following into the blank file:

```html
<h1>Hello world!</h1>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Astro with Starlight">

Now let's build an Astro site with a Starlight template.

:::note[Internet access]
The following requires access to various public websites. If you are using a proxy 
that is restrictive, you may run into connection issues.
:::


```
sudo yarn create astro --install --no-git --typescript relaxed --template starlight /var/www/html/test-app
```

This will create a directory called `/var/www/html/test-app`

Go into `test-app` and update the `astro.config.mjs` with the following:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight';

// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
    outDir: './build',
    build: {
        assets: 'css'  
    }, 
    integrations: [
        starlight({
            title: 'My Docs',
            social: {
                github: 'https://github.com/withastro/starlight',
            },
            sidebar: [
                {
                    label: 'Guides',
                    items: [
                        // Each item here is one entry in the navigation menu.
                        { label: 'Example Guide', slug: 'guides/example' },
                    ],
                },{
                    label: 'Reference',
                    autogenerate: { directory: 'reference' },
                },
            ],
        }),
    ],
});
```
Now run the build

```
sudo yarn build

```

This will build a viable site in `/var/www/html/test-app/build`
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Update apache config

Create a file called `/etc/apache2/sites-available/test-site.conf`

```
sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/test-site.conf
```

Since we're running this in IBM Fyre (private cloud), we're going to use the FQDN of our host here.
But please use your own host name here that was used to create the self-signed certificate above.

```apache
Listen 8080

<VirtualHost *:8080>
    DocumentRoot "/var/www/html/test-app/build"
    ServerName apache-host01.fyre.ibm.com

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/apache-selfsigned.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/apache-selfsigned.key
</VirtualHost>
```

Enable the new config

```
cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled

sudo ln -s ../sites-available/test-site.conf
```

Now restart apache2
```
sudo systemctl restart apache2

```

Verify the site is now up by navigating to https://apache-host01.fyre.ibm.com:8080.

![QSRAP-config1](../../../../assets/images/QSRAP-config1.png)

:::note
If you created the "Hello world" test site then you will see a simple site that says "Hello world!"
instead of the "Welcome to Starlight" page shown above.
:::

We set our test site to port 8080.

### Deploy the proxy

After following the instructions to install the Adaptive Proxy [here](../01_installation/#installing-the-proxy)

Edit the following file `/opt/adaptive-proxy/workdir/adaptive.proxy.location.conf`

:::note[On NGINX configuration]

By default, the best encryption Apache supports is TLSv1.2, so be sure to include 
`proxy_ssl_protocols TLSv1.2` in the config as shown below.

The docker container running Adaptive Proxy will resolve
the host name in `proxy_pass` through the network DNS. It will not use the parent
host `/etc/hosts` file to resolve that host name. So if that name can be pinged without
the use of an /etc/hosts update, then it will work. Otherwise, use the IP address instead.
:::

```nginx
# IBM Confidential
# PID: 5900-B8I
# Copyright (c) IBM Corp. 2024

# Nginx Documentation: https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html
# Location directive documentation: https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location
# file path in server: /etc/nginx/conf.d/location.conf

location ^~ / {
    proxy_pass https://apache-host01.fyre.ibm.com:8080/;
    proxy_ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}

```

Start up the adaptive proxy

```
cd /opt/adaptive-proxy/workdir

./runAdaptiveProxyServer.sh
```

Proxy should come up and our test site should be available now

![QSRAP-config2](../../../../assets/images/QSRAP-config2.png)

:::note
If you created the "Hello world" test site then you will see a simple site that says "Hello world!"
instead of the "Welcome to Starlight" page shown above.
:::

In our case, we're pointing the proxy_pass to the FQDN virtual host we configured on our web server.

:::note[How it works]

The magic is the PORT. You must go to the URL at port 8443 which is where the proxy listens.

In our case, to get to the proxied site:

https://dockerbot21.fyre.ibm.com:8443/

dockerbot21 is our docker host in fyre. His FQDN is `dockerbot21.fyre.ibm.com`

Our apache host is `apache-host01.fyre.ibm.com`

:::

### Verifying the encryption algorithms

:::note
If you created the "Hello world" test site then you will see a simple site that says "Hello world!"
instead of the "Welcome to Starlight" page shown above, but the instructions will be the same.
:::

Now that our site is up and proxied, let's verify that it's using a Quantum Safe algorithm for encryption.

:::warn
Currently there is no PQC encryption available for any TLS certs available from any legitimate Certificate Authority.
:::

In a Chrome brower, go to the site and click the three dots.

![QSRAP-config3](../../../../assets/images/QSRAP-config3.png)

Open the Developer Tools

![QSRAP-config4](../../../../assets/images/QSRAP-config4.png)

Click the `Security` panel

![QSRAP-config5](../../../../assets/images/QSRAP-config5.png)

Here we can see that `X25519Kyber768Draft00` is one of the encryption algorithms and that's Quantum Safe.

## Troubleshooting

### Adaptive Proxy docker container will not start

Run `docker ps` to ensure that the AP container is up and running. If it's not check
the local `logs` directory for `error.log`. There you will see any error messages from
the docker container.

If you see the following message, it means that from within the docker container, the
host name of your site cannot be resolved.

```
[emerg] 1#1: host not found in upstream "quantum-site" in /etc/nginx/conf.d/adaptive.proxy.location.conf:18
```

To resolve, update `adaptive.proxy.location.conf` and replace the host name in `proxy_pass` to use
the IP address of the site instead. Start AP again.
