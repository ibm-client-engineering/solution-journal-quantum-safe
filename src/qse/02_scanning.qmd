## Scanning in VSCode

::: {.callout-note}

## Useful Links

Initiating scans as described [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/quantum-safe/quantum-safe-explorer/2.x?topic=psuqsevsce-initiating-scan-in-quantum-safe-explorer-visual-studio-code-extension)

:::

### Kicking off the scan and seeing results

Let's scan the code base for the `cli` for QSE

In our example, we've created a directory called `QSE` and extracted all the installation elements of QSE.

![Scanning1](/images/scanning1.png)

Open that directory in VSCode.

```bash
cd QSE

code .
```
![Scanning2](/images/scanning2.png)

On VSCode, open a new terminal in the code window. This can be done with the following key combo: Ctrl-Shift-Backtick(`)

![Scanning3](/images/scanning3.png)

In Windows this will open a Powershell terminal

Press Ctrl-Shift-P to open the Command Palette and search for `Quantum Safe Explorer`. 

There are two scanning options available in IBM Quantum Safe Explorer 2.2.5. They are: 

1. **Scan API discovery**: This option will scan all the API discovery supported languages
2. **Scan Cryptography analysis**: This option will scan all the Cryptography analysis supported languages

For a more detailed list on the features and differences of these scans, see [IBM Documentation here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/quantum-safe/quantum-safe-explorer/2.x?topic=quantum-safe-explorer-overview#features)

::: {.callout-note}
Cryptography analysis is currently only available on Java. See [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/quantum-safe/quantum-safe-explorer/2.x?topic=quantum-safe-explorer-overview#languages-and-cryptography-libraries-supported) for up-to-date list of languages and libraries supported
::: 

![Scanning4](/images/scanning4.png)

First, let's click on "Scan API discovery"

The following notification should pop up

![Scanning5](/images/scanning5.png)

Let it scan until it completes.

When the scan completes, you should see the following directories show up in the Explorer window of VSCode:

**qs_explorer_result** and **qs_scan_result**

![Scanning6](/images/scanning6.png)

We should now see the EXPLORER SCAN RESULTS tab populated with some graphs and charts.

## Executing the IBM Quantum Safe Explorer CLI

::: {.callout-note}

## Windows

Make sure that Git Bash is installed and use a Git Bash terminal window for the instructions below.

:::


Change directory to `M0Z1BEN\CLI` or where ever you extracted the CLI files and run the following command:


```bash
/usr/bin/sed -i 's/^RSP_LICENSE_ACCEPTED=.*/RSP_LICENSE_ACCEPTED=true/' LicenseAcceptance.config
```

To make sure you have the correct permissions to run the shell script first run:

```bash
chmod +x cli.sh
```

Next, run the following **help** command 

```bash
./cli.sh -h 
```

::: {.callout-note}
The run will also point out that you have already accepted the licensing agreement.
:::

Before you officially perform the script run, it is helpful to know the list of required/optional parameters:

![QSEmacos1](/images/macos-qse-cli-params1.png)

![QSEmacos2](/images/macos-qse-cli-params2.png)

You initiate a scan using the required **program package path**. The command can be run for single or multiple languages. Here is an example:

**API Discovery Scan:**

`./cli.sh -i <package-path> -l .cs`

**Cryptography Analysis Scan:**

`./cli.sh -i <package-path> -l .java -cf <class-path> -da`

::: {.callout-note}

If you are scanning more than one language, then the command needs to be run in double quotation marks. Use the **Help** command by running `./cli.sh -h` for more details on the various parameters.
:::

Here is an example of a completed scan with a specified program *package path*:

```bash
itzuser@itz-gahknc-help MINGW64 ~/desktop/QSE/M0Z1BEN/CLI
$ ./cli.sh -i ~/desktop/QSE -l .java
Swidtag file already present.

::: {.callout-note}
When scanning large applications (e.g., more than 500,000 lines of code) on macOS systems, IBM Quantum Safe Explorer consumes a large amount of disk space. It is advised to archive and clear the results folder and to reboot the machine before initiating a scan on another application. 
::: 



## Accessing the IBM Quantum Safe Explorer CLI scan results

The results of your scan are written to different folders depending on whether you ran an API Discovery Scan or a Cryptographic Analysis Scan

The scan results for API Discovery languages can be found in the following files:

1. **quantum_safe_api_discovery_cbom.json** - A single CBOM file is generated after the API Discovery Scan for all supported languages, except for Java. For Java, a CBOM cannot be generated at this stage because the required variant details are only available after the Analysis Scan.
2. **quantum_safe_api_discovery_crypto_inventory.json** - Inventory of all cryptographic APIs discovered during the API Discovery Scan, including file names and locations.
3. **quantum_safe_api_discovery_findings.json** - Detailed findings from the API Discovery Scan are available for all supported languages, except for Java API Discovery Scan results.
4. **quantum_safe_api_discovery_report.json** - Detailed metrics information, including the number of files, line counts, and related data.

The scan results for Cryptographic analysis language can be found in the following files:

1. **quantum_safe_cryptography_analysis_cbom.json** - The CBOM file is generated after the Cryptographic Analysis Scan for all supported languages (currently limited to Java).
2. **quantum_safe_cryptography_analysis_findings_<language>.json** - Detailed findings from the Cryptographic Analysis Scan, including vulnerabilities, cryptographic properties, compliance status, and related metrics, are available for the supported languages (currently limited to Java).
3. **quantum_safe_cryptography_analysis_issue_summary.json** - Provide details about any missing dependencies or class files specified in the class path during Cryptographic Analysis Scan. This information helps identify potential causes of scan failures or missing artifacts.


These files are quite verbose. Here's a snippet of the result:

![Accessing1](/images/scan-results-json.png)



## Viewing the CLI scan results in the IBM Quantum Safe Explorer Visual Studio Code Extension

There are two ways to view the CLI output on Visual Studio Code with the IBM Quantum Safe™ Explorer Visual Studio Code extension:
1. Opening the scanned root folder of the project.
2. Opening the scan results subfolder (qs_explorer_result) directly.


### Opening the scanned folder

When you execute a scan, a **qs_explorer_result** folder is generated along with the **qs_scan_result** folder.

![Opening1](/images/scan-results-directory.png)

::: {.callout-note}
To view the results, you need to have the Visual Studio Code extension installed on your system. 
:::


Navigate to the **File** menu drop down, select the **Open Folder** to locate your `/<package-path>` folder:

![Opening2](/images/vs-code-find-project.png)

Once you have found your `/<package-path>` simply open it to populate the project in the Visual Studio Code Explorer view:

![Opening3](/images/vs-code-open-project.png)

The EXPLORER SCAN RESULTS tab is open by default. The scan results are displayed:

![Opening4](/images/scanning7.png)
