## Business Statement

Quantum computing is ushering in a new cryptographic era.

- Quantum Computers can in principle, perform certain mathematical computations exponentially **faster than a classical computer will**. 
- There will be a time when the power of quantum computing may **crack public key cryptographic security protection**.  
- Your **data and security** is already at risk for quantum attacks.  
- Cryptography impacts **everything**. Consider your cryptographic use in four broad areas.  
    - Infrastructure  
    - Applications  
    - Data protection  
    - Key Management  

## Threats

1. **Harvest now, decrypt later** Hackers can collect data now for decryption when quantum computers are powerful enough.
2. **Replacing most of the public-key systems** currently in use will take 5 to 15 years
3. **Lifetime of data** means that sensitive data generated today that is not protected with quantum-safe algorithms is at risk now

With these considerations, many customers are asking the question: **Ok, where do I start?**  

#### <span style="color: blue;">IBM's leadership in the quantum space will guide customers in preparing for a post-quantum cryptography world.</span>


## Proof of Technology - Scope

**Goal** Prove out the IBM Quantum Safe technologies. Demonstrate how they will help identify Cryptographic vulnerabilities and offer a plan of attack to protect their landscape from future Quantum Attacks.
IBM Portfolio Products  

- **Quantum Safe Explorer** Scan applications to discover cryptographic artifacts and vulnerabilities. Creates cryptographic inventory reports (CBOM).
- **Quantum Safe Remediator** 
    - *Adaptive Proxy* - protects communications between apps and end-user devices from quantum attacks. Positions proxy between your server & client's
    - *Performance Test Harness* - test quantum safe algorithms performance in environment before deploying to production
